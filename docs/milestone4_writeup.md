# Milestone 4 Write-Up

To improve readability of the application code, we added comments to sections of code that implemented the maps features since those parts were missing documentation. We decided to make this change because during implementation, we found using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to create the maps especially tricky &mdash; this tells us that others may also have trouble understanding or extending our code, making additional documentation necessary.

While adding these changes, we also noticed other parts that could benefit from additional documentation as well, so we added more comments and improved code readability in general across the application code.

In addition, we had received feedback in milestone 2 to provide definitions for unfamiliar terms in the application in order to help with user understanding. Under the time constraints we had, we were able to add a text burb defining "affordability gap" under the map section to address this feedback. However, what we had originally wanted was to also create a new "About" tab along the top menu bar which would contain a short description of the motivation behind our app and our definitions as necessary. We have added this tab in this milestone.

Lastly, we wanted to showcase this application as part of our data science portfolios/resumes, but the app was originally deployed under only one of our names (Ian's) as part of the shiny app's URL. As part of this milestone, the app is now also deployed by Carrie under a more general name, so that we can now both link to the application under more customized URLs of our own preferences. The application can now be accessed at both links below:

* [Ian's Deployment](https://ian-flores.shinyapps.io/vancouver_tax/)
* [Carrie's Deployment](https://data-vizzy.shinyapps.io/vancouver_tax/)
